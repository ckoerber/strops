### Preferred style of code

We try to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as much as useful (see also [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)).
In this context, we also appreciate formatting along the lines of [black---the uncompromising Python code formatter](https://github.com/psf/black).

### Versioning

Strops follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
Branches start with a `v`, e.g., `v1.1.0` and once merged into master will obtain the previous branch name as a tag.
