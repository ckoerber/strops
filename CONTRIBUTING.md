# Contributing to Strops

Thank you for considering contributing to strops.
On this page, we line out of how to best help out.
And of course, please make sure you are welcoming and friendly (see also the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)).

## Guiding principles & what we are looking for

It is the goal of strops to unite and simplify the efforts of multiple physics communities to connect operators at the fundamental level to experiments. Different communities have different standards and needs that need to be communicated to optimize the usability of this module.
For this reason, we are looking forward to receive any constructive feedback or contributions towards this goal.

Thus, please reach out if you feel...
...this module may benefit you, but certain features are missing or need to be adjusted to be useful. 
...utilized data is incomplete or inaccurate, or more entries would improve the usability.
...you (or know someone who) could help out by actively contributing to the project.

A good starting point is looking at existing issues, particularly related to discussions and providing your opinion. We also welcome you to file additional feedback [using issue templates](https://github.com/ckoerber/strops/issues/new/choose).

## Your first contribution

Providing feedback is already a great help towards improving strops.
If you are interested in doing more, feel free to look at existing issues that match your expertise---some require feedback regarding data, some benefit from implementing new features.

Once you have identified an issue you would like to work on, please post your idea on the specific issue page so that others are informed, and we can ensure contributions are properly acknowledged.

### Updating data

We are currently discussing a proper way of updating data, such that consistency is ensured and tracked over multiple iterations. See also the [issue about updating data](https://github.com/ckoerber/strops/issues/3).

### Preferred style of code

We try to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as much as useful (see also [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)).
In this context, we also appreciate formatting along the lines of [black---the uncompromising Python code formatter](https://github.com/psf/black).

### Code Versioning

Strops follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
Branches start with a `v`, e.g., `v1.1.0`, and once merged into master will obtain the previous branch name as a tag.
